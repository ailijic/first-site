	<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>
        <p>From western Philadelphia I hail
        <p>where in my youth I'd play upon the green
        <p>'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd
        <p>by ruffians contemptible and mean.
        <p>Although the spat was trivial and brief,
        <p>it wounded my dear mother deep within;
        <p>and so, to give her conscience sweet relief,
        <p>she sent me forth to live amongst her kin.
        <p>When to my port of call I'd been conveyed,
        <p>I came upon a coachman most unique;
        <p>and yet, I simply took the trip and paid,
        <p>despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique.
        <p>I survey all the land with princely mien
        <p>in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene.</p>
